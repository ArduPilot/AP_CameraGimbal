# Third-party build dependencies

The `modules/mavlink` git submodule pins the MAVLink message definitions and
the pymavlink generator (`git submodule update --init --recursive`):

| Dependency | Revision | License | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| MAVLink (ArduPilot fork, with pymavlink) | `71d925850d7ddb01d0e56defc1046f9d9d3bf8ae` | LGPL-3.0-or-later generator; generated code MIT (see its `COPYING`) | <https://github.com/ArduPilot/mavlink> |

The camera application generates its MAVLink C bindings from that submodule
at build time with `mavgen.py` under the ignored `camera_app/build/mavlink`
tree, so only MIT-licensed generated code is linked into the binaries.

`make dependencies` and `make mt11_tools` fetch these pinned public build
inputs:

The bootstrap script verifies the downloaded minimp4 header against its pinned
SHA-256. The camera build copies that header and applies
`camera_app/src/recording/minimp4_metadata.patch` to support the `mett` JSON
metadata track and omit the unknown fragment duration header so VLC can
derive duration from the recorded fragments; it also enables fragment
decode-time support. The verified
download is left unchanged. The SS928 checkout is detached at the exact revision above.
The MT11 tools builder likewise verifies every release archive before building
static AArch64 executables. These utility sources and build products remain
under the ignored `build/deps` tree.

The MT11 package also uses the reviewed binary `kernel` and `rootfs` images in
`packaging/mt11/base`. They were extracted from the publicly distributed MT11
V1.0.5 update and are kept separate from the GPL-3.0 project sources. The
rootfs includes third-party userspace and SS928V100 binary kernel modules; the
kernel contains Linux under GPL-2.0. Review the vendor redistribution terms and
corresponding-source obligations before publishing or mirroring these binary
inputs.

The ZR10 backend vendors an MIT-licensed subset of the OpenIPC/divinus
SigmaStar MI ABI headers at revision `0244156023a2ff13fc6571c7851332e0a1818d76`
from https://github.com/OpenIPC/divinus. The declarations and copyright notice
are in `camera_app/src/backends/zr10/mi`; the application package includes the
notice as `OpenIPC-LICENSE.txt`. Camera SDK libraries and factory IQ data are
loaded from the existing ZR10 installation and are not redistributed in the
application archive. The Bootlin ARMv7 hard-float uClibc 2018.11-1 toolchain is
checksum-pinned by `tools/bootstrap_zr10_toolchain.sh`; its toolchain binaries
are build inputs and are not shipped in the camera package.

`tools/install_build_environment.py` additionally installs the Bootlin ARMv7
hard-float glibc 2020.02-2 toolchain for A8 and Arm GNU 10.2-2020.11 for Z1-Mini,
using fixed SHA-256 checksums. It fetches AX620A headers from
[`sipeed/axpi_bsp_sdk`](https://github.com/sipeed/axpi_bsp_sdk/tree/d61e665f44ee145e5bb7cda67d64ac6be0b9097e)
at revision `d61e665f44ee145e5bb7cda67d64ac6be0b9097e` for native Z1-Mini capture.
These remain build dependencies, outside the installed camera payload.

The A8 and ZR10 flash builders use the small checked-in platform sets under
`packaging/a8/platform` and `packaging/zr10/platform`. Their READMEs identify the
source versions and each set has a checked SHA256SUMS. They contain required
kernel modules, ISP tuning and network defaults, with no vendor camera app,
Boa, sound or graphical assets. The kernel modules and tuning retain their
respective component licensing; they are separate from AP application code.
