# Raspberry Pi + libcamera + CADDX gimbal

The `rpi_libcam_caddx` target runs AP_CameraGimbal on a Raspberry Pi CM4
companion computer with an IMX477 CSI camera and a CADDX gimbal, same as
XFRobot C20-T. It runs alongside [Rpanion-server](https://github.com/stephendade/Rpanion-server), which
keeps ownership of networking and the flight-controller link.

Video is captured with libcamera and encoded by the Pi 4 / CM4 hardware H.264
encoder. A single 1080p30 stream is served at `rtsp://<pi>:8554/video1` (and
`/video2`) and used for recording. The `IMG_*` camera parameters (brightness,
contrast, saturation, exposure compensation, ISO, shutter, metering and white
balance) can be changed from the GCS while streaming.

The web interface is served at `http://<pi>:8080/`. The CADDX gimbal is
controlled over a UART, or through a flight controller's serial passthrough;
see [Gimbal](#gimbal).

Not yet supported: photos, zoom and overlays. A Pi 5 / CM5 needs a software
encoder, which is not implemented yet.

## Build

On the Pi (Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm or later):

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential git python3 libcamera-dev pkg-config
git submodule update --init --recursive
make dependencies
make rpi_libcam_caddx
```

The binaries are `camera_app/build/rpi_libcam_caddx/camera-app` and
`web/rpi_libcam_caddx-web`.

## Install

```sh
sudo install -m 755 camera_app/build/rpi_libcam_caddx/camera-app /usr/local/bin/ap-camera-app
sudo install -m 755 web/rpi_libcam_caddx-web /usr/local/bin/ap-camera-web
sudo install -D -m 644 -t /usr/local/share/ap_cameragimbal/webroot web/webroot/*.*
sudo install -D -m 644 packaging/rpi_libcam_caddx/camera.ini /etc/ap_cameragimbal/camera.ini
sudo install -m 644 packaging/rpi_libcam_caddx/ap-cameragimbal.service \
    packaging/rpi_libcam_caddx/ap-cameragimbal-web.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now ap-cameragimbal ap-cameragimbal-web
journalctl -u ap-cameragimbal -f
```

Only one process can use the camera, so leave Rpanion-server's video
streaming stopped.

To update, `git pull`, rebuild, repeat the first three install commands and run
`sudo systemctl restart ap-cameragimbal ap-cameragimbal-web`. Installing
`camera.ini` again replaces any settings changed from the GCS or web page.

## Web interface

Browse to `http://<pi>:8080/` (for example `http://10.0.2.100:8080/` over
Rpanion-server's WiFi access point) and log in as `admin` with password
`ardupilot`; the first start writes it to `/etc/ap_cameragimbal/web.pass`.
Change it on the Users page.

The Live tab plays the camera's video in the browser, the Parameters page
edits `/etc/ap_cameragimbal/camera.ini`, the Debug tab shows the camera
service's journal, and the file browser covers recordings under
`/var/lib/ap_cameragimbal`. Restarting the camera app stops it and lets
systemd start it again; Reboot reboots the Pi. Firmware upload is not offered.
The web page sends its camera controls to camera-app's MAVLink TCP port
(`[mavlink] tcp_port`, 14570).

## MAVLink

The camera listens for MAVLink on UDP port 14570. In Rpanion-server's
Flight Controller page, add a UDP output to `127.0.0.1:14570` so mavlink-router
forwards traffic between the flight controller, the GCS and the camera.

Behind mavlink-router the camera cannot tell which network the GCS is on, so
the RTSP address it advertises in `VIDEO_STREAM_INFORMATION` is a guess: an
address on 192.168.144.0/24 if the Pi has one (the usual SIYI/MT11 camera
subnet), otherwise the numerically lowest non-loopback IPv4 address. When the
Pi has more than one network, for example Ethernet to the flight controller
and WiFi to the GCS, set the address the GCS can reach with a drop-in:

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/ap-cameragimbal.service.d
printf '[Service]\nEnvironment=CAMERA_APP_VIDEO_ADDRESS=10.0.2.100\n' |
    sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/ap-cameragimbal.service.d/video-address.conf
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart ap-cameragimbal
```

## Gimbal

The CADDX gimbal uses the protocol of ArduPilot's `AP_Mount_CADDX` driver
(115200 8N1). It sends no feedback, so the attitude reported to the GCS is the
commanded target. Nothing is sent to the gimbal until the first gimbal command.
Set the link with `CAMERA_APP_UART`, for example with a systemd drop-in:

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/ap-cameragimbal.service.d
printf '[Service]\nEnvironment=CAMERA_APP_UART=/dev/ttyAMA0\n' |
    sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/ap-cameragimbal.service.d/gimbal-uart.conf
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart ap-cameragimbal
```

Without `CAMERA_APP_UART` no gimbal is advertised: camera-app sends no gimbal
heartbeat or `GIMBAL_DEVICE_INFORMATION` and reports gimbal device ID 0 in
`CAMERA_INFORMATION`, so a gimbal connected to the flight controller is not
duplicated.

When the gimbal is wired to the flight controller instead, ArduPilot's serial
passthrough can forward it to the Pi over Ethernet. For a gimbal on SERIAL3
and network port 2 as a UDP server:

```
NET_P2_TYPE = 2         (UDP server; reboot after setting)
NET_P2_PORT = 15002
NET_P2_PROTOCOL = -1
SERIAL_PASS1 = 3        (SERIAL3, keeping SERIAL3_BAUD = 115)
SERIAL_PASS2 = 22       (network ports are numbered from 21)
SERIAL_PASSTIMO = -1    (no timeout, kept across reboots)
```

then use `CAMERA_APP_UART=udp://<flight controller IP>:15002`. While
passthrough is active ArduPilot's own mount driver cannot reach the gimbal;
set `MNT1_TYPE = 0` so only the camera reports the gimbal.

## Environment variables

- `CAMERA_APP_RPI_CAMERA`: libcamera camera ID (default: first camera).
- `CAMERA_APP_RPI_ENCODER`: V4L2 H.264 encoder device (default `/dev/video11`).
- `CAMERA_APP_VIDEO_ADDRESS`: IPv4 address advertised in RTSP URIs.
- `CAMERA_APP_UART`: gimbal link, a serial device or `udp://IPv4:PORT`.
